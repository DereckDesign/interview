<span>Why do you want to design?</span>
<div class="dropdown-content">

i will use these skills to benefit my businesses.</p>

<div class="dropdown">
<span>What is difficult or frustrating for you within design and how do you work to push past that ?</span>
<div class="dropdown-content">
<p>I find illustrating and working with pens and paint very frustrating for me, aswell as package design.
I work to over come this frustration by forcing myself to enjoy it. I know that i have to do it to get to the end goal
and i must learn to like it. sometimes i have to get out of my comfort zone, that’s the only way i’ll learn.</p>

I also enjoy video editing, and hopefully we will get into some of that in the semesters to come.</p>

<span>Can design change the world</span>
<div class="dropdown-content">
<p>I dont think design can change the world, however, i think design can change the world for someone.
It can change the way people see the world and make them see diffrent things that they would’nt be able to
see if it wasn’t for the designer’s work/art.</p>
